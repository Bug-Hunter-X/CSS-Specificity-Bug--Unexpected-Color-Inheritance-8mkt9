The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the specificity of selectors might lead to unexpected results:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this scenario, both selectors target the same element, but `div p` is more specific.  If an element `<p>` is nested within a `<div>`, it will inherit the blue color, overriding the `color: red;` rule.

The issue might not be immediately apparent and can cause unexpected styling inconsistencies, making it an uncommon bug. This is often encountered in large, complex CSS files.
